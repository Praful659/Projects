how to know if there is degeneracy in lpp

**ChatGPT:**
In the context of linear programming (LP), degeneracy refers to a situation where one or more basic variables in the optimal solution of a linear program are equal to zero. It can lead to complications in the simplex algorithm, making it less efficient or causing cycling.
To determine if there is degeneracy in a linear programming problem, you can follow these steps:
<li><p>Solve the LP problem using the simplex method or any other LP solver. Obtain the optimal solution, including the values of the decision variables.</p></li><li><p>Identify the basic variables in the optimal solution. Basic variables are the variables that have nonzero values and correspond to the basic feasible solution.</p></li><li><p>Check if any of the basic variables are equal to zero. If you find any basic variable with a value of zero, it indicates the presence of degeneracy.</p></li><li><p>To confirm degeneracy, you can perform a degeneracy test. One common approach is the "reduced cost" test. Calculate the reduced cost for each non-basic variable in the optimal solution. The reduced cost of a non-basic variable measures the amount by which the objective function coefficient of that variable needs to improve or deteriorate before it enters the basis.</p><ul><li>If all the reduced costs are strictly positive or negative (excluding zero), then the problem is non-degenerate.</li><li>If one or more reduced costs are zero, then the problem is degenerate.</li></ul></li>
It's important to note that degeneracy can be a problem because it may lead to slower convergence or cycling in the simplex algorithm. If you encounter degeneracy, you may consider applying techniques such as perturbation, anti-cycling rules, or using more advanced algorithms like the interior point method to overcome the issue.
Keep in mind that the above steps assume you have access to the optimal solution and its corresponding values. If you're working with a specific LP solver, consult its documentation to determine how to extract the necessary information to identify degeneracy.
